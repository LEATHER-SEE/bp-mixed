## About Leather Defect Dataset

This dataset is splitted in train, validation and test folders in ratio 70:20:10. There are six defects categories: 
- Textural defect
- Discoloration
- Structural irreparable defect
- Structural repairable defect
- Microdefect
- Undamaged

The dataset consists of three different datasets: 

1. *BP Leather Defect Dataset* - our originally created dataset called BP. Categories of this DS are the same as in this dataset. Link to download only BP dataset: https://github.com/LEATHER-SEE/bp 
2. *MVTEC leather defect Dataset* - images cropped to smaller patches and defects adapted to this 6 categories. Augmentation techniques are applied to the images. Link to download original MVTec DS: https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad
3. *Kaggle Leather Defect Dataset* - defect categories are adapted to this 6 categories. Link to download original Kaggle DS: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveen2084/leather-defect-classification
